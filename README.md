# optimal-phylogenies

In this assignment, we will look at some cross-linguistic word form data and use some of the tools we saw in class to build family trees of languages based on the sound forms of words---otherwise known as "optimal phylogenies."

We will use data from the following recent paper.

Dellert, Johannes, Daneyko, T., Muench, A., Ladygina, A., Buch, A., Clarius, N., Grigorjew, I., Balabel, M., Boga, H. I., Baysarova, Z., Muehlenbernd, R., Wahle, J., and Jaeger, G. (2020). Northeuralex: A wide-coverage lexical database of northern eurasia. Language Resources & Evaluation, 54(273â€“301).
